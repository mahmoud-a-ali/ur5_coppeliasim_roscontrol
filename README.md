# ur5_coppeliasim_roscontrol
 A demo shows a full integration of `ros_control` controllers and CoppeliaSim simulator. This package contains the required configuration, scene, and `.launch` files to bring up and control a UR5 robot in CoppeliaSim. This demo is a direct application of both the [RosControl][] and the [RosServices][] plugins provided by `coppeliasim_ros_control` and `coppeliasim_ros_services`.
 
## Dependencies
- [coppeliasim_ros_control][]: a plugin to enable use of `ros_control` in the CoppeliaSim simulator
- [coppeliasim_ros_services][]: this plugin supports a collection of ROS services to enable remote control of the CoppeliaSim simulator
- [coppeliasim_msgs_srvs][]: contains the required `.msg`s and `.srv`s that enable ROS to communicate with and control the CoppeliaSim simulator
- [coppeliasim_run][]: to run CoppeliaSim as a ROS node using a `system(..)` call
- [ur_description][]: contains the description of the ur5 robot   
- [ur_gazebo][]: contains the `arm_controller` which will be used to control the ur5 robot
- [ur5_moveit_config][]: conatians all launch files required for moveit to control the ur5 robot


### Building 
The following instructions assume that a catkin workspace has been created at `$HOME/catkin_ws` and Coppeliasim directory is placed at the Home directory `$HOME/CoppeliaSim`. you always can update the paths based on your machine setup.

```bash
# change to the src directory in your Catkin workspace
 cd $HOME/catkin_ws/src

# Clone Coppeliasim_ros_control pkg 
 git clone https://github.com/mahmoud-a-ali/ur5_coppeliasim_roscontrol

# Clone all dependencies in same workspace
 git clone https://github.com/mahmoud-a-ali/coppeliasim_ros_control
 git clone https://github.com/mahmoud-a-ali/coppeliasim_ros_services
 git clone https://github.com/mahmoud-a-ali/coppeliasim_msgs_srvs
 git clone https://github.com/mahmoud-a-ali/coppeliasim_run
 git clone https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot

# change to the main catkin workspace
 cd ..

# build the workspace (using catkin_tools)
 catkin build

# source the workspace
source devel/setup.bash 
```

### Running
Copy both the `libsimExtRosControl.so` and the `libsimExtRosServices.so` plugins generated by [coppeliasim_ros_control][], and [coppeliasim_ros_services][] to the coppeliasim directory 
```
# Copy the generated plugins to CoppeliaSim directory
cp  $HOME/catkin_ws/devel/lib/libsimExtRosControl.so  $HOME/CoppeliaSim/
cp  $HOME/catkin_ws/devel/lib/libsimExtRosServices.so  $HOME/CoppeliaSim/
```
Launch the demo using the `ur5_demo.launch` launch file
```
 roslaunch ur5_coppeliasim_roscontrol ur5_demo.launch 
```
the `ur5_demo.launch` launch file will:
- start coppeliasim simulator with a scene includes a ur5 robot
- start the simulation
- load ur5 description to param-server by launching the `ur5_upload.launch` file from the `ur_description` pkg
- load the `arm_controller_ur5.yaml` file from the `ur_gazebo` pkg, the arm_controller is a `position_controllers/JointTrajectoryController` ros-controller
- launch the `controller_utils.launch` file from the `ur_gazebo` pkg 
- spawn the `arm_controller` using the `controller_manager` pkg 
- launch the `ur5_moveit_planning_execution.launch` file from the `ur5_moveit_config` pkg
- launch the `moveit_rviz.launch`file from the `ur5_moveit_config` pkg

By launching the `ur5_demo.launch` launch file, you will see two windows: coppeliasim (with a running simulation for ur5 robot) and rviz (with a motionplanning interface configured for ur5 robot), then you can use the motion planning interface in rviz to control the ur5 robot in coppeliasim. you can use also the available msgs/srvs to control the simulation inside coopeliasim.


### Generate your own configuration package
This package contains configuration/launch/scene files to control ur5 robot in coppeliasiom. If you want to create your own configuration package to control your own robot in coppeliasim, follow these steps:
- Create a scene file in CoppeliaSim for your own robot (e.g. `scene.ttt`). If the model of the robot you are using is available in CoppeliaSim, then you just need to create a new scene and drag the model of your robot into the scene. If it is not available, you can use the [urdf_plugin][] to convert your urdf model to a CoppeliaSim scene.
- Create a `controller.yaml` file to specify which controller you want to use to control your own robot.
- Create a `.launch` file to:
    - start CoppeliaSim, pass your robot_scene `scene.ttt` as an argument to the `coppeliasim` node
    - load your robot_description from your `.xacro` or `.urdf` file to the param server
    - load your `controller.yaml` to param server
    - spawn your controller using the `controller_manager` pkg
